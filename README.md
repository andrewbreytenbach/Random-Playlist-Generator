# Random Playlist Generator

## About The Project
This is a web application that allows users to generate a random playlist of songs based on various filters such as their likes, the year, genre, and duration of the playlist. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, with React as the frontend framework. On the backend, it uses Express, Node.js, mysql, and Sequelize, following the MVC architecture pattern.

The app allows users to input their preferences such as the genre, year, and the number of songs they want in the playlist. It then uses an API to fetch data about songs matching the given criteria and generates a playlist. The user can then save the playlist or generate a new one.

The backend server defines API routes for handling the various requests made by the client. It also defines controllers that handle the logic for generating the playlists and fetching data from the database.

## Usage
To generate a playlist, the user selects their preferences such as the genre, artist, year, and number of songs. The app then generates a playlist based on these criteria and displays it to the user.
